# HELM
Helm serves as a powerful package manager for Kubernetes, simplifying the deployment of complex software like Elasticsearch, MongoDB, MySQL, and Redis.

## Process of Deploying Complex Software with Helm
- Add Helm Repository: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

This adds the Bitnami repository, which hosts many popular software charts.

- Update Helm Repositories: helm repo update

Ensures you have the latest chart versions available.

- Search for Available Charts: helm search repo bitnami/mongodb

Find the chart you need and check its available versions.

- Research Default Values:

        * Examine the default values.yaml file in the chart's documentation.

        * Understand which values you need to modify for your use case.

- Create Custom Values File:

        * Create a file, e.g., my-mongodb-values.yaml, with your custom settings.

        * Only include values that differ from the defaults.

- Install the Chart with Custom Values: helm install my-mongodb bitnami/mongodb -f my-mongodb-values.yaml

This command installs MongoDB, applying your custom configuration on top of the default values. Only the fields specified in my-mongodb-values.yaml will override the corresponding default values, while all other settings remain at their default.

### Research Before Deployment
Thoroughly read the chart's documentation, and understand the implications of changing default values.

### Conclusion
By leveraging Helm as a package manager, you can significantly simplify the deployment and management of complex software in Kubernetes environments, allowing you to focus more on your application and less on the intricacies of Kubernetes configurations.
